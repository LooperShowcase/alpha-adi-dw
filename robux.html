      Roblox allows players to buy, sell, and create virtual items which can be
      used to decorate their virtual character that serves as their avatar on
      the platform.[12] Only Roblox administrators can sell accessories, body
      parts, gear, and packages under the official Roblox user account;[20]
      virtual hats and accessories can also be published by a select few users
      with past experience working with Roblox Corporation.[21][22] Several
      individuals design items as a full-time job, with the highest-earning
      creators making over $100,000 a year off item sales.[23] Items with a
      limited edition status can only be traded between or sold by users with a
      Roblox Premium membership.[24] These limited items have a Recent Average
      Price (RAP), with the value of the item fluctuating based off its demand.
      Selling these items for real-world money is against the Roblox terms of
      service, but this does not stop people from doing so through black market
      sites and communities, in which these items are often exchanged for
      payment methods such as cryptocurrency or sometimes PayPal.[25]
      Previously, Roblox would release these limited items themselves until in
      April 2023 when they introduced the "UGC Limiteds" feature, allowing for a
      select group of creators on the platform to design and sell user-generated
      limited items.[26] These UGC limiteds cannot be traded but, however, can
      be resold after a 30-day holding period.[27] Robux allows players to buy
      various items, and are obtained by purchase with real currency, from a
      recurring stipend given to members with a Premium membership, and from
      other players by producing and selling virtual content in Roblox.[28][29]
      Prior to 2016, Roblox had another currency, Tix (short for "Tickets"),
      that was discontinued in April of that year.[30][better source needed]
      Robux acquired through the sale of user-generated content can be exchanged
      into real-world currency through the website's Developer Exchange
      system.[31]
